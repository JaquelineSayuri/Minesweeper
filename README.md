# Minesweeper

The project's goal was to create the game Minesweeper, but in a very simple way, without caring about the interface and assuming that the user is great, so I could purely focus on the logic.

Main function is divided in two parts:
  - **Creating the field:**
      The user is able to choose the size of the field and the difficulty level;
      This section include all the processing for creating the field: calculating the number of bombs, sorting their positions...
  - **Playing:**
      That's the best part, of course. The user need to type the coordinates which correspond to the space he/she wants it to be shown.

To win the game, all the spaces without bombs around them need to revealed (the option of delimit where there's a bomb isn't available. The interesting thing about it is that, after introducing the game for many friends, I noticed they actually don't like using this recourse).

For those who do not have python installed, I put an executable file, so we all can get fun.

I'd like to thank Mestre Chunin for all the help and support.
